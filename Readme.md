Fetch vs. Axios: Choosing the Right Tool for Your HTTP Requests

Both Fetch and Axios are popular choices for making HTTP requests in JavaScript, but they have different strengths and weaknesses. This readme will help you understand the key differences and choose the best tool for your project.

**Fetch:**

-   **Native Web API:** No need to install additional libraries, makes code cleaner and easier to debug.
-   **Simpler Syntax:** Easier to get started with for basic use cases.
-   **Modern Browser Support:** Supported by all modern browsers, no polyfills needed.

**Axios:**

-   **Feature-Rich:** Built-in features like JSON parsing, error handling, request/response interceptors, automatic cancellation, and XSRF protection.
-   **More Consistent API:** Works the same across different browsers and environments.
-   **Better Error Handling:** Provides detailed error messages for easier debugging.
-   **Wider Browser Support:** Works in older browsers with polyfills.
